# Agent instructions

**Note**: This project uses `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs. See @AGENTS.md for workflow details.

- This is a pre-alpha product; if you are making a breaking change, THAT IS OK. You only need to adapt to this breaking change within this project.
- NEVER implement migrations or legacy fallbacks, even when instructed to. We should have a single version of schema, database, and business logic until told otherwise.
