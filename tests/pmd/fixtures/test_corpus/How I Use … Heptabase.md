The ultimate goal of this tool is to produce Documents aka Permanent Notes. I use whiteboards to get from small thoughts to this end, and then the documents can be moved to Obsidian.

## My PKM Structure in Heptabase

[How I Use Tags in Heptabase.md](./How%20I%20Use%20Tags%20in%20Heptabase.md)

### Whiteboard structure

On the map, I have high-level “areas”, which roughly represents the top-level domains in my LifeOS:

1. LifeOS

2. Brain [this.md (Brain).md](./this.md%20\(Brain\).md)

3. Library [this.md (Library).md](./this.md%20\(Library\).md)

4. Thinking

5. etc

> Because there is a many-to-many relationship between whiteboards and cards, and so there is no fixed “home” for a piece of information, these top-level boards serve as both an initial target for storage and an easy way to retrieve. Cards and sub-boards are re-presented in various other places as needed.

### Whiteboard naming

When navigating this app to add or access information, it is unlikely I will want to navigate to some Category or Subject (though I do want to be able to associate a card with one, so it can be referenced and searched for). Instead, I will have in my mind the *why* behind the information. For this reason, I should not use whiteboards primarily to bucket notes by their category (or type, etc); instead, I should use whiteboard that are titled in a very expressive way, having parent whiteboards that add context to that expression. Exception to this is the Library, where I will want to look up by subject.

#### Breaking up the content of whiteboards: object hierarchy

- I should use sections when there are a lot of cards

   - Enables progressive zoom w/ keyboard

   - Sections show in the right sidebar ToC

## General Strategies

### Rely on the Table of Contents

I should structure my whiteboards so that the ToC is a usable tool, metadata that helps me understand what I was trying to do when I created the board.

### Using Tab Folders/Groups

Liberally use these, as an analog of Obsidian Workspaces.

+ ## Ideas

   ### Emoji in Card Titles

   > This has its problems, so. maybe I wan t to not do this anymore

   Use emoji to ~~prefix~~ suffix titles to augment the use of tags for doctypes. Have to move to suffix, otherwise it fucks up the search.

   #### Emoji Legend

   Because tags are only part of the card metadata - which is hidden - I am using emoji to project tag info into some cards to make it more noticeable. The emoji are duplicated in the tag names themselves.

   #### `Is-a` (card is an instance of)

   - 📑 — Document ([Permanent Note.md](./Permanent%20Note.md)s)

   - 📓 — Journal (grnl) or Log

   - 📒 — Notebook (temporary document; “Impermanent Note?)

   - 💡 — Idea

   - 🏅 — Goal/Outcome/Vision (aka some target state)

   - 👷🏻‍♂️ - Project/Action (aka some Effort)

   ### Card colors

   - Use red color coding for items that need attention
