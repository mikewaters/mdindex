# **Intense World Theory Autism**

The Intense World Theory of autism proposes that individuals with autism perceive the world with an enhanced sensory experience and heightened emotional sensitivity. This theory suggests that the brains of individuals with autism are hyper-reactive and hyper-plastic, leading to an overwhelming intensity of sensory and emotional experiences. The theory highlights the following key points:

1. **Hyper-functionality**: Increased functioning of local neural circuits, leading to heightened perception and sensitivity to stimuli.

2. **Hyper-plasticity**: Enhanced ability to form new connections and strengthen existing ones in response to experiences.

3. **Hyper-reactivity**: Stronger emotional and sensory responses to environmental stimuli, making everyday experiences potentially overwhelming.

The Intense World Theory aims to explain some of the behaviors and characteristics associated with autism, such as sensory overload, intense focus on specific interests, and difficulties with social interactions. It provides a perspective that views autism not merely as a deficit or impairment, but as a difference in the intensity of experiencing the world.
