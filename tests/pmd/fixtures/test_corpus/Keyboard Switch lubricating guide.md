# Keyboard Switch lubricating guide

I've responded to more than a couple questions on here about lubing keyboards and since I have my last endeavor documented I though I'd write up a picture guide on how to do it.  I'm not doing it here but you can take this opportunity to do a spring swap if you want. Or even change the stem. You could go from a brown, to a red, to a blue switch, just by swapping the stem and spring. My switches here are Zealios, a special type of tactile Gateron switch similar to an MX Clear.

I don't claim this is the definitive method, but it's how I do it and that's worked out pretty well so far. 

First the tools and links to buy them: [Switch opener](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1363), [Lube](http://www.switchtop.com/product/geekhackers-switch-lube), [Brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B4F1N46/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=linus21-20). It also helps to have a tray to keep loose odds and ends in, like all your removed keycaps.

**(Note, If you are working with loose switches, either you have a hotswap PCB or you're lubing before you solder, then get a switch opener like this : [KBD Fans switch opener](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-part/products/gb-2-in-1-machined-aluminum-switch-opener) or [Gateron Switch Opener](https://www.keychron.com/products/gateron-switch-opener) and skip all the switch opening steps, those are for already soldered switches) **



Insert the switch openers into the two slots on either side of the switch. This works for Gateron and Cherry for sure, not for Kailh. Can't comment on other brands as I don't own any others.  Also this won't work if you have LEDs that go through the switch unless you desolder the LED first. If you have SMD LEDs (ones that reside under the switch) you should be good.



Pry with one tool in toward the switch (not downward but laterally across the keyboard) which will pop up one side.



Then flip that tool over and insert it under the switch top. We're not going to pry at all again on this side, it's just there to prevent this side from snapping back together and closing itself again. These guys snap closed really easily.



Next pry with the other tool, again across the board, not down or up. The second half will take about twice as much force to get open.



It may come off all together or just the top by it self. Just be careful when pulling stuff off that there is no tension on the spring as it can easily shoot itself across the room and disappear forever. 

Here we see just the top has been removed.



Switch top, spring and stem. I put the spring inside the switch top like this so it can't roll away and get lost.



**Skip to this point for unsoldered switches or hotswap boards Instead open the switches with one of these: [KBD Fans switch opener](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-part/products/gb-2-in-1-machined-aluminum-switch-opener) or [Gateron Switch Opener](https://www.keychron.com/products/gateron-switch-opener) **

Time to load up some lube on your brush. You just need a very small amount.  This here is probably a little much.



First I lube the center post in the switch bottom. This is what the spring rides on. So this step not only smooths out the feel of the switch, but also dramatically reduces pinging sounds from the spring. 



Also lube the two channels on either side. This is what the stem rides in. No need to reload your brush at this point.



Next lube the stem. Get all four sides and the under side of the stem where it contacts the spring. Just in the circular channel, you don't need to lube that post. I do reload the brush with some more lube for this step, but only like 25% of what I put on initially. 



Now it's time to reassemble. Put the spring in first. It should feel different sliding in that it did coming off. It should feel softer and more velvety now.



Put the stem on top of the spring. Make sure the little arms on the stem face the electrical contacts. Those arms are responsible for separating the contacts and are what make the switch work at all. If it's backwards the switch won't operate. 



Next put the top back on the stem. The more steeply shaped side of the top should also face the electrical contacts. Press it down gently and it should easiy snap and clip shut. If it's not going on easily don't apply force, something is not aligned up and you might bend the metal contacts. Take it off and double check it's all aligned. 

Once it clips in to place you're done. Move on to the next one. If you get into a real rhythm you should be able to do 1 switch every 45 seconds. Also I use a single key cap to mark my progress so I don't lose my place. 

Addendum: Kail BOX Switches: 

BOX switches are already pretty smooth and don't benefit as much from lubing. Even so, the internals are different so here are the lube points if you do want to do it. I don't think you can open these if they are in a plate so you will need the KBDFans style opening tool that offers a Kailh opening side. [KBD Fans switch opener](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-part/products/gb-2-in-1-machined-aluminum-switch-opener)
