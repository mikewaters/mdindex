# Intelligent Capture

Is a:: Solution

Permit the user to capture information and metadata that is relevant to their life or research, and cause that information to be augmented to fit within their ontological framework and optimized for later retrieval or use. This should work whether the user captures directly into the system, or uses another tool to do capture, enqueue, or mark the information as interesting.



***Information processing***

Information can be:

- Typed and classified according to their world-view (topics, subjects);

- Matched against their research or execution efforts;

- Prioritized based on their current areas of focus or importance;

- Summarized or otherwise augmented or hydrated with related data;

- Snapshotted/retrieved and stored with configurable quality;

[[./MyDesk.md]]

- Transcribed or transcoded based on necessity;

- Subsumed within one or more information collections or knowledge graphs with accurate record keeping.



***Information intake methods***

This should support capture directly into this system, or reflective capture into a secondary system that supported integration.



***Information metadata***

The user should be able to supply metadata at capture time, either by typing it directly, selecting from a static list of items, or selecting from a dynamic list of options. Also, the capture process should transparently collect other metadata, such as timestamps/sources.

This metadata should be provided to the system to be stored alongside the data, and optionally used to inform/improve the automated processes.

Capture, analyze, and process information (data and metadata).
