# Horrible metal pinging sound on my new Ducky One 3 TKL..? : r/DuckyKeyboard

This is a known fact about the ducky's.

I got the same issue with the One 3 full size and I send it back to the vendor to have my cash back

Here is the sound of mine

After some investigation, it seems that the sound was louder on big keyboards. With the smaller ones (mini and sf) this is less audible (even if it is present)

It seems as well that this issue is occuring with the Cherry Mx Red Silent (silent ....!!!!) switches, and users replace the switches and don't have this sound anymore.

It is a shame for keyboards of that price to have this horrible sound which make you crazy.

Very bad quality experience for that particular point.

Wow this is kind of blowing my mind. I've just taken off every keycap and switch and it appears that the issue is tied to the actual switches themselves. I guess it's theoretically possible that some design element of the keyboard is enhancing/making the sound worse - which already exists in certain switches - however, most if not all of the problem I imagine is due to the switches, not the keyboard.

I have many other types of switches. When I insert one gateron oil king switch (no other switches present in the board) the pinging sound is not present. I also have a bag of kailh box browns and some of them create ping but some don't.

I just got mine delivered. Wow. This is really bad.

Returning this for sure. Pissed at Ducky for wasting our time with this.

Damn I'm coming from a Google search because I have the same keyboard and same problem. Does that mean I have to buy new switches? Is it worth it to buy new switches or should I just return the keyboard and get a different keyboard with different switches?

Depends on how much you value the characterists of the Ducky keyboard.

Hi there, I have the same problem. As far as my research goes, the stock Ducky's doesn't come with pre-lubed switches. So we have to lube them ourselves. I got mine with the Cherry MX browns and yes, I can confirm that the metallic pinging sound is just awful. However, I have the lubing staff around, so I am going to do that. You're saying, you don't hear anything without the switches, right? Mine observation is the same. I guess, I will have to spend some hours (days) to lube them browns. Good luck, guys.

That's correct. Some switches come 'factory pre-lubed' but I'm not sure if that includes the spring. Otherwise some people offer lubing services or you can even buy pre-hand-lubed switches, but they are quite costly. Good luck!

Unfortunately it’s not just Ducky’s. I had the same with Steelseries Apex Pro, Corsair K95 RGB Platinum pro and Roccat Vulcan 122. Think it’s known as the ‘filco ping’ and is common for mechanical keyboards with metal top/bottom plates. There are things you can do to minimise it (lube switches, insert foam inside the keyboard body) but opinions vary on the effectiveness. Some people either don’t or barely notice the pinging. For instance it was such an obnoxious sound to me but I had to tell a couple of people when it was happening on the keyboards I went through as they didn’t really notice.

For what it’s worth I ended up with a Logitech g915 as the ping is barely audible (even for me) with it.

I know this may not be the proper subreddit to ask, but the topic is. Do you know if the same thing is happening with the Keychron Q3 (it's the "high-end" TKL from them)? Asking about the stock ones of course. I think I am hearing the same pinging sound (although less noisy) while going through their reviews. Thanks. \*their gateron pro switches comes pre-lubed.

I have the Ducky One 2 and the Ducky One 3, both with Cherry MX Silent Red switches (factory default). Both full size. The ping sound on the One 3 is awfully loud. On the One 2, it is essentially nonexistent. I also have a One 3 with Blue switches. Here the clicky noise is of course more present. But you can hear the ping sound as well.

So, it is not the (unlubed) switches fault. It must be the design of the case. It also clearly changed with the One 3. For example, the top half feels more cheap and plastic on the One 3. I can bend/flex it easily when I press it near the arrow keys. On the One 2 it is sturdy af and does not move when I try it.

Ironically, they claim that they improved the dampening with the One 3 :/

Sadly, I will return my One 3 (because otherwise it's a beautiful board).
