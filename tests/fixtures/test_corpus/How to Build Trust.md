# How to Build Trust

To build trust, Ethan recommends the magic loop. It’s a five-step process that shows your manager you’re their ally and further motivates them to help you.

As trust builds, you’ll move from left to right

Step 1: You need to do your current job well. This is essential. I also mentioned this in one of my first articles on how I went from Junior → Senior in 2 years.

“It’s essential to not skip the base-level responsibilities. If you skip these and try to act like a Senior right away, it will hurt you more than help you.”

Step 2: Ask your manager how you can help them. If you start step 2 by asking your manager how you can help them and they say, “Do your current job well,” you know you’re still on step 1.

Step 3: Do what they ask and be reliable. Establish communication norms and don’t make them chase you for updates.

Step 4: Discuss how you can grow and ask for work that helps advance that.

Step 5: Deliver that work with high quality.

Trust is hard to understand, but Ethan’s definition makes it easy.

“Trust is consistency over time” - Ethan Evans

Think of a friend who never breaks their promise. When they make a promise, you can trust they won’t break it because they’ve shown you they are the type of person who keeps their promises.

Do the same with your manager—consistently deliver next-level work, and they’ll trust you at the next level and want to advocate for your promotion.
