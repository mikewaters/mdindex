**Action Plan**:

- [x] Cancel PIA

- [x] Select and buy a VPN for torrenting

- [x] Install Adguard and Proton on personal devices

- [ ] Install Adguard on the TVs

- [ ] Procure a tool for validating that VPN is working to protect traffic

## Adguard VPN

## Proton VPN

Using this for torrents, and I have a custom script (`tranny`) to run the [Transmission (torrent client).md](./Transmission%20\(torrent%20client\).md) pinned to the VPN network interfaces (IP4 and IP6 IPSEC).
